Overview\nTo help you make an informed decision regarding your participation, this letter will explain what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits, and your rights as a research participant. If you do not understand something in the letter, please ask one of the investigators prior to consenting to the study.\nThis research project will explore how we can better understand and model what a good 'diverse' list of music recommendations looks like on an individual level. Typically, music recommender systems try and provide recommendations they are most confident someone will like based on what they have listened to previously. While they may try and diversify their recommendations, diversity, in this case, is a technical definition with little connection to individual understandings of the concept.\nThis study will explore and test a simple system of filtering music recommendations for different ideas of diversity based on our previous research. By looking at how participants use the system, and by talking to them about their experience with it, we will gain a much better understanding of how to incorporate diversity into music recommendations on an individual level. We will also learn about how individual ideas of diversity are distributed among a larger population. This research is at the Master’s Thesis level, and the results will be submitted for conference or journal publication.\n \nII. Study Details\nIf you decide to participate, we will ask you to interact with a user-interface showing you personalized music recommendations. In order to generate personalized music recommendations, we will first retrieve your music listening history from your profile on the public music discovery platform called LastFM. For participation in this study, we require at least 50 individual scrobbles recorded to your LastFM account in the previous 6 months. We will use your Amazon Mechanical Turk Worker ID to link you to your data during the course of the study.\nShould you choose to give your consent, we will access and download your public Last.fm account's listening history (including data from up to one year prior to the download date) by way of your username, and we will require you to record (scrobble) a specific song, or answer a brief set of questions on your music listening history to prove that the username is yours. Your data will be compared against a previously collected anonymous dataset of Last.FM users in order to automatically generate personalized music recommendations based on other users with similar listens. This process will not merge your data with the existing dataset; your data will always be stored separately.\nThe study consists of two main conditions which are different recommendation methods used to create personalized music recommendations using your music listening data. We will access only the publicly available music listening history which you have recorded to your online LastFM account to generate these recommendations.\nWe will begin the study by presenting you with a survey of questions on your preference for, and definition of, diversity in music recommendations, your age, your self-reported experience level with automated music recommendation services, and a Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality survey. Upon completion, you will move onto the interactive portion.\nEach condition in the interactive portion will present you with 3 ranked lists of 10 personalized music recommendations. Recommendations will appear in the form of album art and 30-second song previews from Spotify accompanied by a brief survey for each list and track. You do not need to have a Spotify account. In total, you will be presented with six lists of 10 recommendations for a total of 60 personalized recommendations. You may take a brief break at any time during the study.\nThe surveys and song exploration will take 40-70 minutes to complete.\nIII. Remuneration\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements of a LastFM account with at least 50 scrobbles in the last year, then for your completion of the study you will receive $4 USD. The amount received is taxable. It is your responsibility to report this amount for income tax purposes.\nIV. Withdrawal\nParticipation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to share your Last.fm username, decline to interact with the interface, and decline to answer any questions in the questionnaire or the interview at any time. Data that is shared with Last.fm is subject to their terms of service (https:\u002F\u002Fwww.last.fm\u002Flegal\u002Fterms). If after finishing any task or completing any survey you wish to withdraw the data you have provided, you can do so by contacting Kyle Robinson at kyle.robinson@uwaterloo.ca. You can withdraw your data at any point in time up until the associated paper is submitted to an academic conference\u002Fjournal or included as part of thesis work in October2020.\nV. BenefitsThere are no direct personal benefits for participation, though we hope that you enjoy the music recommendations provided to you during the study.\nVI. Risks\nThere is small a short-term risk of feeling you may be judged by your music listening history. Any data linking your identity to your online Last.FM profile will be kept on a secure database accessible only to the researchers and anonymized upon completion of the study. Additionally, the process used to generate music recommendations uses automatic mathematical operations and the researchers will not actively view or review your listening history or recommendations.\nVII. Confidentiality\nIt is important for you to know that any personal information that you provide will be confidential. In order to participate in this study you will be required to have an existing active Last.fm account. Last.fm is an online music sharing platform that records your music listening history to a public online profile. Last.fm accounts do not require personal information (with the exception of an email address) and can, therefore, be created anonymously. Music listening data which is uploaded to Last.fm is subject to their terms of service (https:\u002F\u002Fwww.last.fm\u002Flegal\u002Fterms), and all profiles on Last.fm are publically accessible using their associated username. Over the course of the experiment we will require your unique Last.fm username, which will give us access to your publically available listening history. We will also be recording your interactions with the user-interface. Your responses provided will be stored by your MTurk Worker ID. Your survey responses, song ratings, music recommendations, and Last.fm data will be stored on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server.\nUpon completion of the study your Last.fm username and Worker ID will be removed from all datasets and replaced with a generic identifier (i.e P1, P2); we will neither follow nor observe your Last.FM profile. We will maintain a secured file linking your Worker ID to your participant ID until the associated paper is sent for publication in order to allow you to withdraw. Your data will be anonymized, combined, and stored locally on a password-protected computer database. The data will be electronically archived and maintained for a minimum of 7 years before being destroyed. The anonymized music listening history and data from interactions with the user-interface (with any personal information excluded such as Last.fm username) might be shared publically for the purpose of reproducing study results. With permission, anonymous quotations may be used in publications\u002Fpresentations resulting from this research.\nYou will be completing this study on an interactive system hosted on AWS. When information is transmitted over the internet privacy cannot be guaranteed. There is always a risk your responses may be intercepted by a third party (e.g., government agencies, hackers).\nVIII. QuestionsShould you have any questions about the study, please contact Kyle Robinson (kyle.robinson@uwaterloo.ca) or Dan Brown (dan.brown@uwaterloo.ca). Further, if you would like to receive a copy of the results of this study, please contact either investigator.\nETHICS STATEMENT: This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE #42388). If you have questions for the Committee contact the Office of Research Ethics, at 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or ore-ceo@uwaterloo.ca.\nIX.
